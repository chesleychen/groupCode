pay attention!
Let's follow the standard as below:
 1. we have 10 nodes in total and the writing quorum is 7.
 2. everyone do the writing operations for 20 times in total at each node.
 3. please do not use the message command "read", this is saved for monitor read operation communication.
 4. I will notify everyone if I need new command for monitor in case that it is conflict with existing command.
 5. please bring up any problem with group :)
